#  Mouser
A lightweight script to control the cursor with the keyboard

## Description
It's meant to move the mouse and click with the keyboard when I am feeling too lazy to 
move my hand a few inches to the right and use the mouse

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/lacotus/mouser.git
2. From here you can either manually run it or set it up to run automatically with taskscheduler

## Usage
Running:            If script not ran automatically then manually trigger from terminal using 'python trigger.py' in src dir
Triggering:         Use keycombo <alt><shift><j>
Directional Keys:   W - up, A - left, S - down, D - right
Click Simulation:   J - left, K - middle, L - right

## Contributions
Contributions welcome, please submit a pull request or open an issue. Need to work on smoother directional changes
and holding down clicks
